I need to make my existing social media application fully responsive for mobile devices. 

CRITICAL BRANDING CONSTRAINTS:
1. Do NOT change my existing color palette, fonts, or overall aesthetic. The "PinkQuill" branding must remain buttons or inputs.
- ONLY modify the container widths, display properties (hidden/block), and layout positioning to fit exactly as it is.
2. Do NOT change the Desktop view. The Desktop experience must look exactly identical to how it is mobile screens.

Please perform these steps strictly:

1. LAYOUT REFACTOR (The 3-Column System now.
3. Use Tailwind CSS breakpoints (md:, lg:) to only apply these changes to small screens.

THE):
   - Open my main layout file (likely `app/(feed)/layout.tsx` or similar).
 GOAL: 
On mobile, the app should function structurally like Instagram/TikTok (Bottom Navigation, Full Width Feed), while keeping   - Currently, it displays [LeftSidebar] [Feed] [RightSidebar].
   - Modify the Tailwind classes to implement this Logic:
     - MOBILE (Default): Hide LeftSidebar (`hidden`). Hide RightSidebar (`hidden`). Make my specific design style.

Please perform these 4 specific refactors:

1. LAYOUT REFACTOR (The the Feed container `w-full` and `p-0`.
     - TABLET (md:): Show Container):
   - Open `app/(feed)/layout.tsx` (or your main layout file).
   - Currently LeftSidebar (`md:block`). Show Feed. Keep RightSidebar hidden.
     - DESKTOP (lg: or xl:): Show all three columns.

2. NEW COMPONENT: Mobile Bottom Navigation
   - Create `components/layout/MobileBottomNav., it likely displays [LeftSidebar] [Feed] [RightSidebar].
   - Change the class names to hidetsx`.
   - It should be `fixed bottom-0 left-0 w-full z-50`. sidebars on mobile:
     - LeftSidebar: Add `hidden md:block`.
     - RightSidebar: Add `hidden lg:block`.
     - Feed Container: Change fixed widths to `w-full` on mobile, but keep existing widths on desktop (e.g., `w-full md:w-[600px]`).

2. CREATE
   - It must use my existing color scheme (white background, border-t, pink accents for active state).
   - It should contain  MOBILE BOTTOM NAVIGATION:
   - Create a new component `components/layout/MobileBottomNav.tsx`.
   - It must5 icons (Home, Explore/Search, Create (+), Communities, Profile).
   - Only render this component on mobile be `fixed bottom-0 left-0 w-full z-50`.
   - Style it using my existing white screens (`block md:hidden`).

3. NEW COMPONENT: Mobile Top Header
   - Create `components/layout/MobileHeader.tsx`.
   - It should be `fixed top-0 left-0 w-full z-5/glass background colors so it matches the theme.
   - Include 5 Icons (Home, Search, Create/Post, Communities, Profile).
0`.
   - It should display the "PinkQuill" logo (centered or left) and the Notification Bell.   - Only show this component on mobile (`block md:hidden`).

3. CREATE MOBILE TOP HEADER:
   - Create a
   - Only render this on mobile (`block md:hidden`).
   - Add padding-top to the main feed new component `components/layout/MobileHeader.tsx`.
   - It must be `fixed top-0 left- so content isn't hidden behind this header.

4. FEED & POST ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Open 0 w-full z-50`.
   - It should contain the "PinkQuill" text logo (left) and the Notification Bell (right).
   - Style it to match my brand.
   - Only show this on`Feed.tsx` and `PostCard.tsx` (or whatever my post component is named).
   - Search for any hardcoded widths like `w-[600px]`. Change them to `w-full max- mobile (`block md:hidden`).
   - Add padding-top and padding-bottom to the main feed container so the contentw-[600px]`.
   - Ensure the main feed container has `pb-20` (padding bottom isn't hidden behind these new fixed bars.

4. FEED & CARD WIDTHS:
   - Scan ) on mobile so the last post isn't hidden behind the Bottom Nav.
   - Add `overflow-x-`Feed.tsx` and `PostCard.tsx`.
   - If there are hardcoded pixel widths (e.g., `whidden` to the main wrapper to prevent side-to-side wobbling.

5. FINAL CHECK:
   - Ensure-[600px]`), change them to `w-full max-w-[600px]`.
   - Ensure images use `w-full h-auto` to prevent horizontal scrolling.
   - Ensure `overflow-x-hidden` is applied the desktop view looks EXACTLY the same as it did before. The sidebars should only disappear when the screen gets smaller.
